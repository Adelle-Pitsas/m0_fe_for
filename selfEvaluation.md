# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  - I feel pretty confident with for statements as we have learned them. I think that I still need practice with the vocabulary and describing the parts of the for statement.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  - It felt really good to run through a list of possible solutions to the challenges, and research how to execute those ideas. It did get frustrating after trying many of my solutions and not having luck. When that happened, I reached out to one of the people in my small groups that was also working on it at the same time and we discussed our possible solutions. It was helpful to talk to someone else about it instead of struggling alone.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I still need to practice verbalizing the parts of the for statement. I will practice this before class tomorrow.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - I don't think I have any more questions at this point.
